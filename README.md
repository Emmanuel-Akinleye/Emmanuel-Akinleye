### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**`Digital Craftsman (Game Developer, Youtuber,  3D Animator)`**

As a game developer, 3D animator, and YouTuber, I'm passionate about creating immersive digital experiences that transport players to new worlds. With expertise in Unity, I craft engaging gameplay mechanics that help in my stories to life. In addition to game development, I specialize in 3D animation and have experience creating high-quality character models, rigging and animation. When I'm not busy developing games or creating animations, you can find me sharing my knowledge and experiences with my YouTube audience which is "[Hazer Digital][youtube]", providing tutorials, showcasing my projects and having fun with my community.
